{prompt_task}
I have {n_indivs} existing algorithms with their codes as follows:

{prompt_indiv}Please create a new algorithm that has a totally different form from the given algorithms. Try generating codes with different structures, flows or algorithms. The new algorithm should have a relatively low objective value.
First, describe the design idea and main steps of your algorithm in one sentence. The description must be inside a brace outside the code implementation. Next, implement it in Python as a function named '{func_name}'.
This function should accept {n_inputs} input(s): {joined_inputs}. The function should return {n_outputs} output(s): {joined_outputs}. {inout_inf} {other_inf}
Do not give additional explanations.
