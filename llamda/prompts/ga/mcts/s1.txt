{prompt_task}
I have {n_indivs} existing algorithms with their codes and objective values as follows:

{prompt_indiv}Please help me create a new algorithm that is inspired by all the above algorithms with its objective value lower than any of them.
Firstly, list some ideas in the provided algorithms that are clearly helpful to a better algorithm. Secondly, based on the listed ideas, describe the design idea and main steps of your new algorithm in one sentence. The description must be inside a brace. Thirdly, implement it in Python as a function named '{func_name}'.
This function should accept {n_inputs} input(s): {joined_inputs}. The function should return {n_outputs} output(s): {joined_outputs}. {inout_inf} {other_inf}
Do not give additional explanations.
