I have one algorithm with its code as follows.

Algorithm's description: {indiv_algorithm}
Code:
{indiv_code}

Please create a new algorithm that has a different form but can be a modified version of the provided algorithm. Attempt to introduce more novel mechanisms and new equations or programme segments.
First, describe the design idea based on the provided algorithm and main steps of the new algorithm in one sentence. The description must be inside a brace outside the code implementation. Next, implement it in Python as a function named '{func_name}'.
This function should accept {n_inputs} input(s): {joined_inputs}. The function should return {n_outputs} output(s): {joined_outputs}. {inout_inf} {other_inf}
Do not give additional explanations.
